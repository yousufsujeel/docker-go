The Dockerfile provided follows many best practices for building a Go application in a Docker container. 

## Best Practices Explanation
# Multi-Stage Builds:

The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds, which is a common best practice to keep the final image small and secure. The first stage (builder) is used to build the Go binary, and the second stage (scratch) is used to run the compiled binary in a minimal environment. This approach helps reduce the size of the final image by excluding unnecessary files and build tools.
Using a Minimal Base Image:

The scratch base image is the smallest possible image in Docker, containing nothing. This ensures that the final image is as lightweight as possible, containing only the compiled binary and necessary configurations.
# Non-Root User:

Running the container as a non-root user is a security best practice. This reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. The Dockerfile creates a non-root user (appuser) and runs the application as that user.
The passwd file is copied from the builder stage, where the user is created, to the scratch stage to ensure the non-root user is recognized in the final image.
# WORKDIR:

Setting the WORKDIR simplifies file paths in subsequent commands and ensures that all operations occur within the specified directory. It also improves readability and maintainability.
Dependency Management:

The Dockerfile first copies go.mod and go.sum and runs go mod download. This allows Docker to cache the dependencies layer, speeding up subsequent builds as long as the dependencies havenâ€™t changed.
Copy Only Necessary Files:

The Dockerfile copies only the Go source files and the go.mod/go.sum files, ensuring that unnecessary files (e.g., local configuration files, README, etc.) are not included in the build context, which helps keep the image size small.
Minimal Final Image:

By using scratch as the base image and copying only the compiled binary, the Dockerfile creates a minimal and secure container that contains nothing but the necessary application binary.
# USER Directive:

The USER directive sets the user for the subsequent CMD instruction and for any process that runs inside the container. It ensures that the application does not run with root privileges.
